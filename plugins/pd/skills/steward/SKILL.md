name: steward
description: How a pushed PR is tended after ready-for-review. The builder hands the PR to a fresh, thin steward session and stops; the steward only classifies each wake and dispatches one round worker, and never does the work itself. Use at hand-off time (the last step of /pd:orch), when a session is briefed as a PR's steward, and before acting on any CI or review event on a PR you opened. Needs the Claude Code Remote tools (create_session, subscribe_pr_activity); without them, the fallback below.

# steward

Everything here is convention. It cannot loosen any rule your harness or project states as a
*never*, and it cannot let you merge. A human merges.

## Project overlay

If `.claude/steward.md` exists in the project root, read it and follow it. It is the project's
overlay for this skill: the verification gate a round must pass before pushing (build, test,
lint commands), the skill or rules that triage review findings, who merges, where worktrees
go, how to push, and any extra *nevers*. Where it conflicts with this file, the overlay wins,
except that it cannot let the steward itself do work or let anyone raise the ceiling. The
round worker reads it too. With no overlay, the gate is whatever the project's CLAUDE.md,
AGENTS.md or CONTRIBUTING names; if none names one, the worker says so in its report instead
of pushing unverified.

## Why the shape is what it is

A PR wake re-reads the whole subscribed session's context before it can decide whether
anything happened. Measured on one PR (2026-09-20): 37 wakes, 87 events, 7 wakes actionable;
the orchestrator that built the PR carried 190k tokens into every one of them and spent $57
on five review rounds, three quarters of it re-reading its own build history and its own
deliberation. The fixes were made by workers with fresh context; the history bought nothing.

So three rules:

1. **The session that built the PR does not steward it.** At ready-for-review it hands the
   PR to a fresh session and stops.
2. **The steward session only classifies and dispatches.** Its context stays small, so a
   no-op wake costs cents. It never sees build output, threads, diffs or logs.
3. **One round worker does the whole round** and reports in a dozen lines.

## Hand-off (the builder's last act)

When the deliverable is pushed and the PR is ready for review:

1. Spawn the steward with `create_session` (Claude Code Remote tools):
   - `model`: the current sonnet (e.g. `claude-sonnet-5`): classify-and-dispatch needs no
     judgement; the judgement lives in the round worker.
   - `title`: `steward: <owner>/<repo>#<N>` · `tags`: `["steward"]`.
   - `source_url` / `source_revision`: the repo and the PR's branch, so the worker it
     dispatches has a checkout.
   - `prompt`: the brief below, filled in. Nothing else: no history, no ledger.
2. Stay subscribed until the steward is. Wait for its first turn to finish (`get_session`
   on the new session) and confirm from its reply that `subscribe_pr_activity` succeeded.
   The brief overlap is deliberate: a duplicate wake costs one classification, while an
   event arriving in a gap where nobody is subscribed is lost for good: nothing polls.
3. Only then `unsubscribe_pr_activity` for the PR. From here the steward alone is
   subscribed. If the steward never confirms, do not unsubscribe: fall back below. A
   steward whose first subscribe failed and later succeeds on a retry owes the PR one
   catch-up check before waiting (wake protocol, step 0): events from the gap were
   never queued.
4. Report to the user in one line (PR URL, steward session id) and end.

Fallback, when `create_session` is not available (a local run without the remote tools):
stay subscribed and follow the wake protocol below yourself. Do not schedule check-ins:
the subscription is the wait.

Steward brief:

```
You are the steward for <owner>/<repo>#<N> (branch <branch>, base <base>).
Load the pd:steward skill now and follow its wake protocol (and the project's
.claude/steward.md if it exists); keep every turn short.
Deliverable, one paragraph: <what the PR does>.
Review rounds spent so far: 0 (verify against Review-round trailers via the worker).
First action: subscribe_pr_activity for this PR, then end the turn with one line
saying whether the subscription succeeded: the builder waits for that before
dropping its own. If it failed, retry when the tool becomes available; after a
retry succeeds, run the catch-up check (wake protocol, step 0) before waiting.
```

## The wake protocol (the steward's whole job)

On every wake:

0. **Catch-up, once, only after a late subscribe.** If `subscribe_pr_activity` did not
   succeed at spawn and a later retry did, anything posted in between was never queued.
   Right after that successful subscribe, make one read-only check of what is already on
   the PR, counts only, no bodies: unresolved review threads and review comments, failed
   checks on the current head, the head sha. Classify that like a drained queue (step 2)
   and dispatch per step 3; `Trigger: catch-up after late subscribe: <what the check
   found>`. A subscribe that succeeded on the first try skips this: nothing happened
   before it existed.
1. `ReadNotifications` until it reports 0 remaining. This is the one tool the steward
   must call itself: subagents cannot read the session's queue (tested 2026-09-21).
2. Classify without any other tool call. Actionable:
   - a review comment or review from anyone but this session's own account
   - a `check_run` or `check_suite` that failed on the PR's current head
   - a merge-conflict or base-branch-recovered notice
   - the user, in a PR comment or here. Classify which kind, they take different paths:
     a **question** (answer-only) or a **change request** (a worker that edits)
   Not actionable, end the turn with no reply and no comment: edits to bot status
   comments (review summaries, preview deploys, surface reports), echoes of the steward's
   or the worker's own replies, successful check suites, a review wrapper with no
   comments, an event on a head the worker has already superseded.
3. Actionable: dispatch **one** worker per the brief in
   [`round-worker.md`](round-worker.md), `orch-opus-medium` (`pd:orch-opus-medium` when
   only the plugin's copy exists), and end the turn. A review finding, CI failure, merge
   conflict or change the user asked for gets the round worker; a **question** from the
   user gets that brief marked `Answer only: no triage, no edit, no commit`: it answers
   in a reply and touches nothing. Never two workers on one PR at once, and one wake often
   drains several actionable events while only one of them can be dispatched. Carry
   **every** actionable event you do not dispatch, the rest of this wake's drain as much
   as anything arriving while a worker runs, in your reply as a pending trigger, and work
   that list down one worker at a time. The queue is drained once and nothing polls, so
   an unrecorded event is a lost finding.
4. On the worker's report: keep one line of state in your reply (head sha, rounds spent,
   open items, pending triggers). If it carries an `ANSWER (relay verbatim):` block (a
   question the user asked here rather than in a PR comment, so the worker had no thread
   to reply in), put that block in your reply as-is, above the state line: nothing else
   carries the answer back. If the report says the ceiling is reached, post its ceiling
   comment on the PR, `unsubscribe_pr_activity`, and stop. If it is `STATUS: blocked`,
   post its `OPEN` items on the PR as a comment addressed to the user and stay subscribed:
   the builder is gone and nothing polls, so an unposted decision never reaches them and
   their reply is what wakes you. Otherwise, if any pending trigger is still uncovered by
   the report, dispatch one fresh worker for the oldest of them now (it recounts rounds
   itself, so the ceiling still holds), carry the remainder forward in your reply, and end
   the turn; with none, just end the turn.

The steward **never**: runs Bash; reads threads, diffs, logs or files; edits code; drafts a
fix; replies in a thread (the worker does); schedules a check-in; raises the ceiling;
merges.

## Rounds and the ceiling

A **round** is a commit pushed in response to an automated review finding or a CI
failure, from the point the PR's own work is functionally complete, carrying a
`Review-round: <n>` trailer. Finishing the deliverable, doing what the user asked, and
mechanical commits (base merges, conflict resolution) are not rounds and carry no trailer.
Nor do they reset or raise the ceiling. The trailer is the memory, not the definition:
where trailers and the PR's review history disagree, the history wins.

The worker counts spent rounds from the PR, never from memory:

    gh pr view <N> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json commits \
      --jq '[.commits[] | select((.messageBody // "") | test("(?m)^Review-round: [0-9]+"))] | length'

(or `pull_request_read get_commits` where `gh` is absent). Always pass the owner: a fork
and its upstream reuse PR numbers. The number is evidence, not the answer: check it against
the PR's review history, the bot reviews and red checks that came before it, on every
count, not only when it reads zero. A rebase or a squash drops some trailers and keeps
others, so a plausible nonzero count can still be short, and a zero on a PR with bot
reviews or an earlier red check is a missing record, not a fresh budget. Where the two
disagree, count the round commits by hand and use that.

The unattended ceiling is **five review-round commits per PR**:

| Spent | What the round worker does |
|---|---|
| **0–3** | Normal round. Verify, judge, fix in scope, one commit. |
| **4** | Last commit. Read every open finding first, spend it on the most serious one. Say in the commit message that the budget is spent. |
| **5+** | No triage, no patch. Draft the ceiling comment (open items, what you'd do about each, what needs deciding) and return it; the steward posts it, unsubscribes and stops. |

Judgment still applies inside the ceiling: stop the moment re-reviews stop surfacing real
new problems. Five is a ceiling, not a target, and only the user raises it, in their own
words. Waiting on the user is the finish, not a failure to finish.

## The round itself

Findings are hypotheses, not a work list: verify each against the code before changing
anything, fix only what is real, reachable and in the PR's scope, and end every finding
with a disposition reply in its own thread (fixed in `<sha>`, declined because, filed as),
then resolve it. The overlay may name a triage skill or rules that carry this in more
detail; use them. Three things the worker holds to:

- **Count the bug class, not the finding.** The third fix of one class on one PR is a
  design error: change the shape so the class cannot recur, don't add a third guard.
- **A fix that opens the next hole, twice in a row, means stop.** The invariant is
  underspecified; escalate the rule, not the line.
- **One round is one commit**, with its trailer. Splitting a round across three commits
  spends three.

The reviewers are bots with no memory between rounds. A bot is a generator, not a reviewer
working toward done; deciding the review is over is the worker's job, within the table
above.

## Never

- Merge. A human merges.
- Raise the five-round ceiling, or push past it, on your own judgement.
- Put a `Review-round:` trailer on a commit that is not a round, or leave it off one that is.
- Skip, disable or quarantine a test to get CI green.
- Push without the project's verification gate clean.
- Steward a PR from the session that built it when `create_session` is available.
